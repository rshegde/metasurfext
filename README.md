This code is for designing and optimization of beam deflectors using global optimization techniques: Genetic algorithm and Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. It was written for the purpose of doing calculations described the paper "Rapid design of wide-area heterogeneous electromagnetic metasurfaces beyond the unit-cell approximation" at doi:10.2528/PIERM17070405.
